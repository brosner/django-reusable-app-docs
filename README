This project is meant to hold documentation on how to build and maintain
Django reusable apps. This document is going to serve (for now) as the place
of my current ideas.

One item on the Pinax TODO/wish list is to have good documentation about all
aspects of a Django resuable app. This includes, but not limited to:

 * how to write one
 * how to release one
 * best practices

The documentation should be clear and structured logically like the Django
documentation itself. This documentation should cover:

 * admin
 * internationalization
 * models
 * feeds (if applicable)
 * templates
 * templatetags
 * documentation
 * distribution
 * generic views
 * urls
 * tests

I really encourage anyone to fork this project and start contributing patches
back to me. I can certainly envision there will need to a lot of dicussion
about how things should be. Lets get it started again.

James Tauber started a mailing list and freenode IRC channel for this exact
stuff. django-hotclub [1] and #django-hotclub [2] respectively.

Also, I have setup a hosted location for the documentation [3]. This is
automatically updated from the master branch every ten minutes.
